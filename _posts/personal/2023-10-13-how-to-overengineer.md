title:  How to overengineer a website

So, you want a website. For most, there are plenty of user-friendly, no-code tools out there, ready to build your site for free. But for engineers, it's a different story. We love to overengineer, crafting websites with lightning-fast loading times and intricate CI/CD workflows. Why? Because we can.

My journey into website creation defied conventions. Instead of following the recommended path, I delved into static site generators, HTML, CSS, and Sass, alongside GitHub Actions and Cloudflare Pages.

## **The Vision**

Before typing a single line of code, I envisioned the end result. These questions guided me:

1. **What's the purpose of this website?**
2. **Which technologies should I embrace?**

My answers led me to create a blog site and a portfolio hub. The blog served as a repository, documenting my experiments with various technologies. It wasn't just about showcasing; it was a way to reflect on my progress and experiences.

My second goal was to learn HTML/CSS. Instead of starting from scratch, I chose to modify a template, ensuring a unique touch without overwhelming complexity.

## **Additional Factors**

**1. Maintainability**

Keeping things simple and low-maintenance was crucial. Virtual machines and EC2 instances were off the table. I needed a setup that required minimal monitoring. Relying solely on HTML/CSS for website delivery fit the bill.

**2. Cost-Efficiency**

Originally, I considered AWS offerings like CloudFront and S3 static websites. Concerns arose regarding DDoS protection and costs. After exploring options, GitHub Pages and Cloudflare Pages emerged. GitHub Pages is free, but I opted for Cloudflare Pages due to its rapid deployment speed, ensuring a seamless user experience. While GitHub Pages works wonders, Cloudflare Pages' speed and reliability won me over.

In the realm of website creation, overengineering is our playground. We thrive on pushing boundaries, not because it's necessary, but simply because we can.
