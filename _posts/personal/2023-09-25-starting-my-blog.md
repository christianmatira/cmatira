Throughout my IT journey, I've ventured into various technologies. Whether it was deciding between Zabbix, Nagios, or Prometheus for my monitoring needs, delving into how to process the raw data in Zabbix's database, or constructing a robust ELK + Wazuh stack for log and security event monitoring, I've amassed a treasure trove of experiences. Yet, my most significant regret has been keeping these valuable insights and hard-earned lessons to myself, hidden from the eager eyes of fellow tech enthusiasts.

## The Dawn of Blogging

Let's face it â€“ documentation is the bane of every engineer's existence. But it's an evil we grudgingly embrace, knowing that without it, we risk losing the intricate details of how we built those services, the architectural design of the service, and the communication between those services. This becomes even more apparent when we use different technologies to meet diverse project demands. Over the years, I've built and implemented a lot of services using opensource software. And now, I'm ready to share them with the world through this humble blog.

## What Awaits You

Welcome to the beginning of a thrilling journey! My mission here is to simplify building a service, Share the gotchas and lessons I have learned, And to build a small but scalable version of it with AWS. I was previously focused on Openstack, I also have tried other cloud platforms like GCP, Azure, and Digital Ocean, my current focus is AWS. Simply because I want to gain AWS certifications.
