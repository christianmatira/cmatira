I am a Linux system administrator, Python enthusiast, and cloud engineer based in the Philippines. 

My journey began with High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters for university researchers, where I managed the facility and optimized various applications. This facility also hosted virtual machines and a data-sharing platform for researchers, some of which were open to the public. As I collected telemetry data from managing the cluster, I developed a passion for Python and its applications, particularly in machine learning, spurred by the release of TensorFlow.

In 2018, The company migrated our virtualization platform to OpenStack, giving users more control while allowing us to step in only for specific issues. This transition aligned well with my Python expertise. Additionally, as our cluster and user base grew, I delved into DevOps to automate tasks and improve efficiency among our team.

Looking ahead, I am committed to expanding my certifications, recognizing their value in the IT industry. But above all, I prioritize enjoying life, understanding that we have only one chance at it.
